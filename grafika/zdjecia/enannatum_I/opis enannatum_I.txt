A stone plaque of the time of the First Dynasty of Lagash in Southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq).
 
Enannatum I (c.2420 BC), seen here in attitude of worship and named at top left, was by some accounts brother of Eannatum, who ruled most of Sumer, best known now from the fragmentary 'Stele of the Vultures' in the Louvre.
 
Stone plaque perhaps from a temple: from Girsu (modern Telloh, Iraq), a site excavated by the French between 1877 and 1933.
